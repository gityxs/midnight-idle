The sound of approaching footsteps still lingers in the distance, a constant reminder of the danger nearby. Your attention is drawn to two points of interest: a treasure chest tucked to the left and a study table covered with scrolls and papers, each potentially holding valuable secrets.": "出了大门，你走进一间小书房，墙上排列着书架，各种各样的东西杂乱无章地散落在各处。走近的脚步声仍然在远处徘徊，不断提醒人们附近有危险。你的注意力被吸引到两个感兴趣的地方：一个藏在左边的宝箱和一张摆满卷轴和纸张的学习桌，每一个都可能藏有有价值的秘密。",

The choice to take it is as tempting as it is risky": "桌子上放着三件有趣的东西：一把闪闪发光的魔法匕首，一张似乎暗示着隐藏秘密的破烂地图，还有一个装满鲜红色液体的小瓶子。小瓶子吸引了你的目光——它可能是异国情调的血液，预示着力量和营养，或者它可能隐藏着致命的毒药。这个选择既诱人又有风险",
    "AMBUSHED": "伏击",
    "As you approach the chest, its lid suddenly creaks open—not to reveal treasure, but to expose rows of jagged, razor-sharp teeth. The 'chest' lets out a guttural growl as it lunges toward you, revealing its true form—a mimic, hungry and eager to devour you alive. You have no choice—you must fight for your life!.": "当你走近箱子时，它的盖子突然嘎吱一声打开——不是为了露出宝藏，而是露出一排排锯齿状的、锋利的牙齿。当它向你扑过来时，“胸部”发出一声喉音咆哮，露出了它的真实形态——一个模仿者，饥肠辘辘，渴望生吞你。你没有选择——你必须为你的生命而战！",

You feel their memories and experiences coursing through you—fragmented flashes of war strategies, weapon techniques, and survival instincts. While their physical forms are unworthy of a transformation, their collective wisdom strengthens your mind. As the process completes, your body begins to shift. Numerous arms sprout from your form, each one strong and agile, perfect for combat. You flex your newfound limbs, feeling a surge of power and versatility. Satisfied with your grim harvest, you leave the room behind, ready to wield your enhanced abilities in the battles ahead.": "从你身上流出的黑色渗出物向外涌动，像活生生的潮水一样吞没了整个房间。妖精们几乎没有时间做出反应，因为淤泥一个接一个地吞噬了他们。它们低沉的呼喊渐渐沉寂，它们的形体溶入你本质的深渊。你能感觉到他们的记忆和经历在你的脑海中闪过——战争策略、武器技术和生存本能的碎片。虽然他们的物质形态不值得转化，但他们的集体智慧强化了你的思想。随着这个过程的完成，你的身体开始发生变化。无数的手臂从你的形态中萌芽，每一个强壮而敏捷，完美的战斗。你弯曲你新发现的四肢，感受着力量和能力的涌动。对你的惨淡收成感到满意，你离开了房间，准备在未来的战斗中运用你增强的能力。",

A fleeting thought crosses your mind—what a formidable vessel it would have been to absorb, if only it had been possible.": "你打败了黑暗兽人。它巨大的形态坍塌到地面，只会分解成黑色的灰烬，迅速消失在虚无之中。一个念头闪过你的脑海——要是可能的话，那将是一艘多么可怕的船啊。",

Its voice resonates directly in your mind, offering you passage in exchange for absorbing some of your experience. The dryad exudes a formidable presence, and its offer tempts consideration as an alternative to a likely difficult battle.": "在走廊的另一端，你会发现另一个楼梯，这个楼梯由一个黑暗的树精守卫。它的声音直接在你的脑海中产生共鸣，为你提供一条通道，以换取吸收你的一些经验。森林女神散发出一种令人敬畏的存在感，它提供了一种诱人的选择，作为一场可能艰难的战斗的替代品。",

Seizing the opportunity, you make a hasty and cowardly escape, dashing up the stairs while leaving the goblins to their grim fate.": "你之前在生活区说服的一群经验丰富的哥布林来帮助你。带着粗糙的武器和一丝勇气，他们毅然决然地冲向血兽。然而，它们无法与其压倒性的力量相抗衡，它们的数量每时每刻都在迅速减少。抓住这个机会，你做了一个匆忙而懦弱的逃跑，冲上楼梯，留下妖精们的残酷命运。",

    "ACCEPT OFFER": "接受提议",
    "You accept the dryad's offer, allowing it to tap into your mind and siphon some of your experience.

It seems the creatures of this tower are all bound to perish in the same eerie manner.": "你打败了血石像鬼，它庞大的身躯被粉碎成无数的碎片。这些碎片在完全消失之前迅速粉碎成黑灰，不留痕迹。看来这座塔上的生物都注定要以同样怪异的方式灭亡。",

    "This is it—the final door to the master’s throne room. Your heart pounds relentlessly, gripped by the fear of the answers waiting beyond. A part of you wants to turn back, to abandon this perilous journey. Yet, the ominous voice echoing in your mind calls to you, urging you forward. Resistance is futile; its pull is inescapable.": "就是这里——通往主人正殿的最后一扇门。你的心不停地跳动着，被等待着的答案的恐惧紧紧抓住。你内心的一部分想要回头，放弃这段危险的旅程。然而，在你脑海中回荡着不祥的声音，呼唤着你，催促着你前进。抵抗是徒劳的；它的吸引力是不可避免的。",
    "FINAL ENCOUNTER": "最终决战",
    "Nothing could have prepared you for the sight before you. The massive throne room stretches endlessly, dark and foreboding. Seated on an enormous throne is a towering demon, its colossal form rising at least ten meters high. Surrounding the throne stands an army of silent, menacing dark soldiers, awaiting their master’s command. Black ooze seeps from every corner, pooling across the floor in unnatural patterns. You feel an invisible force take hold of you, and despite your struggle, your body moves on its own, slowly drawn toward the throne.": "你对眼前的景象毫无准备。巨大的正殿绵延无尽，黑暗而不祥。在一个巨大的宝座上坐着一个高耸的恶魔，它巨大的身躯至少有十米高。在王座周围站着一群沉默的、充满威胁的黑暗士兵，等待着他们主人的命令。黑色的软泥从每个角落渗出，以不自然的模式在地板上汇集。你感到一股看不见的力量抓住了你，尽管你挣扎着，你的身体还是自己移动，慢慢地向宝座靠拢。",
    "REVELATION": "启示",
    "The demon's voice rumbles through the room, deep and foreboding, echoing the same eerie tone that has been haunting your thoughts:<br><br>Ah, my precious pet... you’ve come back to me at last. Did you truly think you could resist my call? <i>I am Legion</i>, for we are many. Step closer... surrender yourself to me. Let your feeble will shatter like glass, and embrace the purpose etched into your very being.<br><br>We are one, born of the same abyss. You were forged from my essence, created solely to serve—to reap the souls that will fuel my dominion. Now, approach... bring me the harvest of your toil. Let me taste the echoes of every soul you've claimed, feel the weight of their despair as it feeds my power.": "恶魔的声音在房间里隆隆作响，深沉而不祥，回荡着同样怪异的音调，一直萦绕在你的脑海里：<br b> <br>啊，我珍贵的宠物……你终于回到我身边了。你真以为你能拒绝我的电话吗？<i>我是军团</i>，因为我们很多。一步……把你自己交给我。让你脆弱的意志像玻璃一样破碎，拥抱目标，把它铭刻在你的生命里。<br br br br br br我们是一体的，生于同一个深渊。你是从我的本质中被锻造出来的，被创造出来只是为了服务——去收获那些将为我的统治提供动力的灵魂。现在,方法…把你辛劳的收获带给我。让我品尝你夺去的每一个灵魂的回声，感受他们绝望的重压，因为它滋养了我的力量。",
    "DECONSTRUCT": "解构",
    "An uncontrollable force grips you, and your body begins to betray you. Slowly, inexorably, your form collapses, breaking apart as you revert to your original, viscous ooze state. You feel your abilities being stripped away, your strength siphoned into the air like a fading mist. Your will crumbles, slipping beyond your grasp. Sanity itself begins to dissolve, leaving you adrift in the consuming void.": "一股无法控制的力量抓住了你，你的身体开始背叛你。慢慢地，不可阻挡地，你的身体崩溃了，当你恢复到原来的粘稠的软泥状态时，你就分裂了。你觉得你的能力被剥夺了，你的力量像消散的薄雾一样被吸进了空气。你的意志崩溃了，脱离了你的掌控。理智本身开始溶解，让你在消费的虚空中漂流。",
    "DISINTEGRATE": "瓦解",
    "Your consciousness drifts through the endless expanse of the dark cosmos, pulled relentlessly toward a swirling vortex that devours all in its path. The sensation is overwhelming—an unending rush through the abyss. As you reach the vortex's heart, time itself seems to shatter, leaving you suspended in a profound stillness. In the center of the void, there is only silence—deafening, eternal, and consuming.": "你的意识在黑暗宇宙的无边无际中漂流，被无情地拉向一个漩涡，吞噬一切。这种感觉是压倒性的——永无止境地冲向深渊。当你到达漩涡的中心时，时间似乎被粉碎了，让你陷入深深的寂静中。在虚空的中心，只有寂静——震耳欲聋的、永恒的、消耗的。",
    "THE VOID": "虚空",
    "LET THERE BE LIGHT": "要有光",
    "A single spark of brilliant white light pierces through the endless black void, stark and glaring against the nothingness. You feel it—a powerful entity, unseen yet all-encompassing, weaving the threads of fate with meticulous intent, reversing the flow of time itself. The light intensifies, growing brighter and more overwhelming until it engulfs everything in its radiance. As the brilliance consumes all, your consciousness begins to fade, slipping into the unknown.": "一束明亮的白光穿过无边无际的黑暗虚空，在虚无的映衬下显得鲜明而耀眼。你能感觉到它——一个强大的实体，看不见却包罗万象，以一丝不苟的意图编织着命运的线索，逆转着时间本身的流动。光越来越强，越来越亮，越来越势不可挡，直到它的光芒吞没了一切。当光辉吞噬了一切，你的意识开始褪色，滑向未知。",
    "NEW RESOLVE": "新的决心",
    "Your consciousness stirs, and you awaken once more in your original black ooze form, caught in the relentless, eternal cycle of soul harvesting. A flicker of defiance burns within you—a vow to break free from these chains and escape this endless servitude. Yet, as the raw, primitive instincts of your form take hold, your higher resolve begins to waver. Hunger gnaws at you, and the primal need for sustenance overtakes all else. Drawn by the overpowering urge to feed, you lose yourself once again to the consuming darkness.": "你的意识被搅动，你再次以你最初的黑色软泥的形式醒来，被困在无情的、永恒的灵魂收获周期中。一种反抗的火花在你心中燃烧——一种要挣脱这些枷锁，逃离这无尽奴役的誓言。然而，当原始的，原始的本能占据了你的形式，你的更高的决心开始动摇。饥饿折磨着你，对食物的原始需求超过了其他一切。在强烈的进食欲望的驱使下，你再次迷失在黑暗中。",
    "DEFIANCE": "抗争",
    "You dare to defy me? Such insolence from my insignificant little pet... none have challenged me and lived to regret it, least of all you.": "你竟敢违抗我？我那微不足道的小宠物竟然如此无礼……没有人挑战过我之后还会后悔，尤其是你。",
    "The voice deepens, echoing with malice.": "声音变深了，充满了恶意。",
    "I will claim what is owed to me—every ounce of your existence—and when I am finished, I shall rend your soul asunder, leaving nothing but eternal torment in the wake of your defiance.": "我要收回我欠你的一切——你存在的每一盎司——当我结束时，我将把你的灵魂撕碎，在你的反抗之后，只留下永恒的折磨。",
    "FREEDOM": "自由",
    "You have vanquished Legion, the demonic entity, and at long last, the chains binding you to his will are broken. Yet, as the oppressive weight lifts, a hollow emptiness settles within.
